# Create a Matrix class
# Create initialize fucntion to turn input string into matrix of integers
# Cast integers to strings
# Include way of accessing rows
# Include way of accessing columns
#### I have already completed a matrix exercise and can reuse that code ####

# Work out minimum value in each column
#Â Work out maximum value in each row
# See if those values match?
# Return an array of [row, column] for each saddle point
